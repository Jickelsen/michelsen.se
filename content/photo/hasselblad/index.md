I picked up a Polaroid SX-70 recently, and shooting with it has been very inspiring! I still like my Instax cameras but I enjoy the unpredictability of the Polaroid Originals film (previously Impossible) more.  I am at a loss as to what happened here in the bottom right though!

Using 600 film in this camera leads to slight overexposure even with the exposure wheel turned all the way to dark. However sometimes it's just too much work digging out the ND filter!
