title: Distanced March - Spring Was Here
subtitle: Leica M8 with 7Artisans 50mm f/1.1
summary: I took these during a March morning walk. I never thought I'd own a Leica but if they're old (2006) and broken enough they can be affordable! The colors are something extra and it's the perfect match to the 7Artisans 50mm

I took these during a March morning walk.

I never thought I'd own a Leica but if they're old (2006) and broken enough they can be affordable! The colors are something extra, even after post-processing, and it the perfect match to the 7Artisans 50mm.
