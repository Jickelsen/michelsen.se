title: Distanced April - Rock
subtitle: 7Artisans 50mm f/1.1 and speedboosted Canon lenses
summary: Took a break over summer, but now I'm back to uploading again. April didn't rock but here is some rock. Many of these were taken just a short walk away, I'm very grateful to have such beautiful nature just next door!
