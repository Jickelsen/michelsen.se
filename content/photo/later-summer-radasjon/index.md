title: Later Summer at Rådasjön
subtitle: A lake, a ruin and a quarry. GM5 and iPhone XR.
summary: Another \#throwbackthursday, another lake. The last swim of the summer, at Rådasjön with an old quarry and a fake 19th century ruin! A bit different look to these as I had a different process at the time. What do you think?
