Throwback to the first party with the Polaroid SX-70 this summer. Thanks for throwing on the lights Appz! Got a bit overconfident with the natural light so this is about a one second handheld exposure. Who says photos have to be sharp though!

The top scan is actually from just an hour or so after taking; this is what it looked like the next day. I actually prefer the lower contrast and pastel colors in the "fresh" one!
