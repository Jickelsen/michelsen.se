title: Distanced May - Knipeflågsbergen
subtitle: 7Artisans 50mm f/1.1 on Leica M8
summary: A nature reserve close to home. I love to chill here on the hills. You probably recognize the little wind torn tree from the Heights photo set as well. All shot with my beloved, slightly busted Leica M8 with my favorite lens.
