title: Distanced April - Fauna
subtitle: 7Artisans 50mm f/1.1 and speedboosted Canon lenses
summary: To be honest, I encountered little wildlife during my time in the forest this spring. There were some deer, but I never quite got any good photos of them. All I got were their ticks! The horses belong to Gunnebo Ryttarsällskap.
