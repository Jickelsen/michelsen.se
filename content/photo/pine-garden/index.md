Incidentally this is the exact spot where I created my first Monster Hunter character.

I recently started using [Jamie Windsor's film emulation presets](https://jamiewindsor.com/presets3)  for Lightroom and I am smitten! I am especially happy with the skin tones of the Portra presets, and it even manages to emulate the grain very well (though the 35mm grain preset is a bit too heavy with too much detail being lost).

I recently switched from Halide to the Lightroom camera for iOS RAW photography, as I was running into numerous bugs with the former. Very happy so far!
