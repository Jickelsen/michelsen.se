title: Stockholm March 2020
subtitle: Yashica Electro 35 with Lomo 100 film (I think), speedboosted Canon 50mm on X-Pro2 
summary: On this day a year ago I visited Stockholm for the last time. I sold a camera and bought my beloved Leica M8, and also took some photos with both Fujifilm and the Yashica. It was quite a different world and I miss it so much!

Here's the Yashica doing street duty. It's not the greatest rangefinder but I did manage to set focus pretty quickly.
